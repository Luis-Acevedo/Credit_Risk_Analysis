# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## New Tools 

Our team has been hired to test credit card data for bias and apply new machine learning modules. The company believes that a newer machine learning model could allow for better opportunities for it's customers. Using the same dataset we will be taking 6 different machine learning modules and comparing them. We will look and see if the two new machine learning modules have any significant changes.
